# code-snippets-bank
As you complete projects, you will naturally start to reuse code and patterns. Systemize this.

*   **Create a private GitHub repository called "Code-Snippets" or "Toolbox".**
*   **Organize it by technology or purpose:**
    *   `selenium/automate_login.py`
    *   `python/pandas/clean_csv_data.py`
    *   `javascript/fetch_api_data.js`
    *   `sql/common_queries.sql`
*   **Whenever you solve a tricky problem, add the code to your bank with comments.** Next time you face a similar task, you're not starting from zero; you're starting from 80%.
